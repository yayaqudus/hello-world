<h1>Suratul Fatiah</h1>
<h2>In the name of Allah, The most Gracious, The most Merciful</h2>
<p>
  All thanks is due to Almighty Allah.<br>
  The Beneficient, The Merciful.<br>
  Master of the day of Judgement.<br>
  Ye only shall we worship. And Ye only shall we seek help from.<br>
  Guide us to the right path.<br>
  The path of those that has been favoured by You.<br>
  Not the path of those that has been rejected and cursed.
